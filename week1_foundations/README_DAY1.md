# Day 1 – Lists & Loops

## Objectives
- Work with Python lists, loops, and basic assertions.
- Comfortable syntax, like Java developers.

## What to do
- Open `day1_lists_loops.py`
- Review the comments and code
- Run with: `python day1_lists_loops.py`
- You should see the printed list and "✅ Day 1 checks passed!"
- Add another test case (e.g. `"CheckoutTest"`), print it, and adjust assertions.

Once done, commit and push your code.
